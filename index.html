  <p> Tyler was born in Washington DC in 1986.  A lover of reading and learning, he was a disappointing student growing up.  However, as he has matured and grown up he has become an adult learner.
  Tyler grew up playing baseball and played through college.  He played first base and outfield, while he was his harshest critic he never stepped back to enjoy his talents and let them flourish
  most productively.  He was a good player, just lacking in confidence.  Tyler graduated with a Bachelors in Business Management, waited a decade and then graduated again, this time with an MBA.  Tyler lives
  in Behtesda Maryland with his wife, son, parents, grandparents and family dog.</p>
